## Magnetic Field Measurement with Varying $\mu$-Veto Gaps

This project revolves around the measurement of noise of the SQUIDs amplifiers in two different setups (Veto on and off). The findings indicate that the Veto Gap induces a measurable magnetic field, which can be traced by the earth magnetic field.
<br>We contain two notebooks with the noise measurements of the corresponding campaign of the 13.05 and 24.05 and one notebook showcasing the characteristic pattern of the SQUID sensors for crossvalidating the noise data.
<br>Furthermoe we include a notebook with magnetic field measurements (projection in the 3 axis directions) involving different veto gaps for further tracing the magnetic field dependence of the veto.
